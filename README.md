# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import numpy into the editor 
### Step 2:
Input the co-ordinates to calculate the distance between them.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the solution.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

import math 
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2]
a=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(a))
```
### OUTPUT:
![py 1c](https://github.com/Boobeshkrishna/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/141472052/71efcbcc-d027-424a-943b-b662498901f0)


### RESULT:
The distance between the two points is displayed successfully.
